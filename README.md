# BattleGrid
Simple networked battle grid for Nexus 7.
Built with Android Studio 1.2.1.1

This is a student project for CS 372 - Intro to Comnputer Networks, at Oregon State University (OSU), Spring term 2015.

We are creating a simple battle grid that consists of a 5x9 grid, and colored circles as tokens. The battle grid will be able to connect to other copies of the app, and changes made by one app will be propogated to other connect copies.

Our dimensions are hard coded (to save time) and only suitable for the Nexus 7 in landscape view.
